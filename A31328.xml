            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> To put on Chriſt, is to name the Name of Chriſt, [or, <hi>to profeſs Chriſtianity,</hi>] and depart from all Iniquity. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>HOw doth your Baptiſm oblige you to depart from all Iniquity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> So many of us as are baptized into Chriſt, were baptized into his Death: therefore we are buried with him by Baptiſm into Death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the Dead by the Glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in Newneſs of Life. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Doth not our Baptiſm oblige us to love one another, and to keep the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes: For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one Body. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13.</p>

            <p>Q. <hi>How long is the Death of Chriſt to be remembred in the Lord's-Supper?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> As often as we eat this Bread, and drink this Cup. we do ſhew the Lord's Death till he come, [or, <hi>till he comes to Judgment.</hi>] 1 Cor. 11.26.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>May the Cup be denied to any that receive the Bread, as the Papiſts do to all the Laity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No certainly: For Chriſt took the Cup and gave thanks, and gave it to them, ſaying, Drink ye all of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.27.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Is the Lord's-Supper a proper Sacrifice, or is the Body of Chriſt again offered up therein for the Quick and Dead, as the Papiſts ſay?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, by no means: But<note n="(a)" place="bottom">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26.</note> his Death is therein ſhewed forth:<note n="(b)" place="bottom">

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Chriſt hath told us his Meaning, in ſaying, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> Luke 22.19.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Is Chriſt's Body confined always to Heaven?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Heavens muſt receive [or, <hi>retain</hi>] him, until the times of reſtitution of all things, [or, <hi>till the laſt Day.</hi>] <hi>Acts</hi> 3.21.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How may we worthily receive the Lord's-Supper?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Let a Man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What if you ſhould receive the Lord's-Supper unworthily,</hi> that is, <hi>in the allowance of known Sins?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh Damnation to himſelf, not diſcerning the Lord's Body, [or, <hi>not making a difference between the Lord's Supper and his ordinary Meals.</hi>] 1 Cor. 11.29.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What is the Advantage that accrues to thoſe who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily receive it;</hi> that is, <hi>that receive it with firm Reſolutions againſt all Sin, and with a thankful Senſe of the Love of Chriſt?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A. To ſuch</hi> the Cup of Bleſſing which we bleſs, it is the Communication of the Blood of Chriſt; and the Bread which we break, it is the Communication of the Body of Chriſt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How doth the Receiving the Lord'-Supper farther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage unto Holineſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> the Receiving thereof doth farther engage us to Holineſs, as it is a ſhewing forth of Chriſt's Death; whoſe Love <hi>in dying for us</hi> conſtraineth us <hi>[to all holy Obedience:]</hi> becauſe we thus judg, that if one died for all, then were all dead; and that he died for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live to themſelves, but unto him which died for them, and roſe again. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Doth it not for the ſame reaſon in a ſpecial manner engage us to</hi> love each other?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes: For we are commanded to walk in love, as Chriſt alſo hath loved us. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>For what</hi> other <hi>Reaſon doth it engage us to love each other?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> For this Reaſon, becauſe we being many, are one Bread and one Body; for we are all Partakers of that one Bread. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What is Prayer?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Prayer is the making known our Requeſts to God, with Thankſgiving <hi>for all the good things we have received.</hi> Phil. 4.6.</p>
